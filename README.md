Amazon CloudFront: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that delivers content quickly to users worldwide, useful for efficiently distributing both static and dynamic web content.

<h1>Email Delivery Service:</h1>

Amazon SES (Simple Email Service): Implements a service to send summarized news emails to subscribers every morning at 6 AM. SES allows for the reliable sending of mass emails and provides statistics related to email dispatching.

<h1>Revenue Model</h1>

Subscription Service: Users can subscribe monthly or annually via the website. Subscribers receive summarized news in their email every morning at 6 AM, offering a more in-depth and ad-free experience compared to regular free content.
This system provides a technologically sophisticated yet user-friendly service, representing a modern way to consume news content. Additionally, by leveraging AWS's robust cloud infrastructure, it allows for a scalable and easily manageable system.
